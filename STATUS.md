# Status

This artifact is applied for (1) Artifacts Evaluated - Functional, (2)
Artifacts Evaluated - Reusable, and (3) Artifacts Available. We believe the
artifact is deserved to award these badges because:

1. Artifacts Evaluated - Functional: this artifact contains several carefully
   documented `README.md` files, along with complete code and necessary scripts
   corresponding to the associated paper. It also provides (partial) benchmark
   data used in its evaluation.

2. Artifacts Evaluated - Reusable: this artifact provides the reusability for
   further evaluation. In particular, the main implementation offers an
   easy-to-use interface, and scripts for several comparison targets lead a
   user to reproduce/imitate further experiments.

3. Artifacts Available: this artifact is open-sourced via GitHub with a tag,
   referring to the exact version of the artifact evaluated, as well as a
   commit hash, a unique identifier for the object. Moreover, several necessary
   data, such as benchmark, is shared with Zenodo.
